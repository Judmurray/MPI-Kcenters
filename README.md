# MPI-Kcenters
This project outlines the use of MPI as a computing architecture and some of its advantages. 

The premise of this project is essentially the same as the 3centers project, however we are now generalizing the idea to n-centers and using the distributed computing 
architecture, MPI (Message Passing Interface). The purpose of this project is to show that MPI does not run into shared memory issues and is therefore more suited for a larger range of problems as opposed to OpenMP. Additionally, this project was helpful in exploring the various advantages of shared vs distributed memory, and scenarios in which either would be more beneficial to use.
